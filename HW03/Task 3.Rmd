# Task 3
***


#### Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.


```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(trim_mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp, trim=0.01)) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  select(year, trim_mean_lifeExp)

  
  
  
```
