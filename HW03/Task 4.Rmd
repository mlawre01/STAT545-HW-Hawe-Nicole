#### How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?

For this question I decided to group by continent and year, and then compute the mean for life expectancy over the different continents every year data was taken.

```{r}
n6 <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) %>% 
  select(continent, year, mean_lifeExp) %>% 
  arrange(year) 

kable(head(n6),format='markdown')
# I used head here to give a glimpse of the quite large table produced

```


```{r}
n6 %>% 
   ggplot(aes(year,mean_lifeExp,color=continent)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  ggtitle("Mean Life Expectancy per Year for Each Continent")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

 
```
