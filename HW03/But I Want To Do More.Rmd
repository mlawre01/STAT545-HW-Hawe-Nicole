library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gridExtra)
# loaded grid extra to help put table and figure side by side
```

#### Layout Stretch Goal

Okay so I had trouble using the code found [here](http://gist.github.com/jennybc/e9e9aba6ba18c72cec26)
SO I found another was using [gridExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/gridExtra.pdf)



So remember from Task 3 we had:
```{r}
n5 <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(trim_mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp, trim=0.25)) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  select(year, trim_mean_lifeExp)

t1 <- kable(n5)
t1

```
Also the accompanying plot:
```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(n5, aes(x=year, y=trim_mean_lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(colour="purple", size=3) +
  labs(x="Year", y="Trimmed Mean LifeExp")+
  ggtitle("Trimmed Mean Life Expectancy") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
p2
```


then we need to define a tableGrob for grid extra:

```{r}
t1a <- tableGrob(t1)
grid.arrange(p2, t1a, nrow=1)
```

Then the second part of this

#### Table Stretch Goals

I decided to venture into pander to make a different style of table

```{r}

library(pander)
```

```{r}
pander(n5)
```
There this gives another table making option!

I chose pander with the help found [here](https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/464132152347475968)
