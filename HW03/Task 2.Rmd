# Task 2
***

#### Look at the Spread of GDP per Capita Within the Continents

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~continent, scales="free")
```

Then I created a table for this however I was a bit worried about the size of a table for this sort of data:

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  select(continent,gdpPercap) %>%
  kable()
```
