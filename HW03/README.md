## Homework 3: Use of dyplyr and ggplot2 to Manipulate and Explore Data
***

### Information About this Folder


Welcome!

The overall goal of this homework assignment was to get us to use both dyplyr and ggplot2 to gather information and produce figures using the gapminder dataset. We were given a list of tasks and told to choose at least 3 to produce a table and figure for.

I decided to do something a little different with the organization of this assignment. Since there were a number of tasks thaat required quite a bit of coding, I broke each task down into it's own file, and provided links at the bottom of each task page to the next. 

### The Tasks

1. Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents. [Task 1](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW03/Task_1.md)

2. Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents. [Task 2](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW03/Task_2.md)

3. Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean. [Task 3](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW03/Task_3.md)

4. How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents? [Task 4](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW03/Task_4.md)

5. Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy – you decide – a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.[Task 5](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW03/Task_5.md)

6. Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.[Task 6](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW03/Task_6.md)

Then additional "I Want To Do More": [My Attempt](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW03/But_I_Want_To_Do_More.md)

- Layout stretch goal: get table and figure side-by-side. 

- Table stretch goal: there are some really nice fancy table helper packages.

Let me know what you think!

### Reflections/Thoughts

I found this particular homework assignment to be quite overwhelming at first, will all these tasks and sort of broad guidelines. Once I started tackling them I realized that I am slowly starting to understand the power of dyplyr and ggplot, which was very reassuring. 
I am starting to really like how far you can go customizing things in ggplot, and enjoy the visual reward of those coding efforts!

I spent a long time trying to figure out how the heck to put a table and graph side by side and still was not successfull with the code found [here](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/e9e9aba6ba18c72cec26) I would really love a solution!

In retrospect maybe the every task with a separate file was not the best idea, I apologize for the clutter, and I hope the information is easy enough to find!
