# How Hw01 Edits were executed

- I when to github and created a new Repo
- I decided to edit my Readme locally
- Then I opened RStudio and went File->New Project->Version Control->Git
- I then cloned my new repository into RStudio (via copying the link)
- Here I opened the Readme and made my edits in the Rscript window
- I then saved, went over to the Git tab, pulled from the repo, then committed my edits, and pushed them to my Repo 
- I checked these edits online via Github

## R Markdown Section of Hw01

- I opened the R markdown file started in class on Thursday Sept 14
- I made a few edits to the headers and cleaned the document up by deleting some additional notes on R markdown
- Then in order to keep the R markdown file I went to the gear icon-> Output options-> Advanced -> keep R markdown source file
- I also hand edited the YAML to make the output be a github_document
- I saved this file, pulled from the Git repo, committed my .md and .rmd files, and then pushed them to my repo
