# Homework Assignment 5
***

Welcome to the **FINAL** Homework assignment for STAT 545!!!

You can find the [Markdown file here](https://github.com/nicolehawe/STAT545-HW-Hawe-Nicole/blob/master/HW05/Factor_and_Figure_Management.md)


For this assingment I stuck with the Gapminder dataset to complete some of these main goals:

- Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.

- Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.

- Implement visualization design principles.

- Write some data to file and load it back into R. E.g., save a plot to file and include it in a R Markdown report

### REFLECTIONS

- Wow first of all I had no idea what a factor really was before this class and assignment! this caused me to spend some extra time trying to get a grasp of it.

- I am not sure if I interpreted the difference between forcats:fct_drop versus the base function droplevels....I would love more of an explanation as to why forcats drops all the other information in the original dataframe.

- I think how data is represented visually is so so so important. It is something I often struggle with and I really enjoyed learning more tools such as colour brewer to help me better represent important information

- I also enjoyed comparing what my graphing originally looked like when I had very few ggplot skills to now where I have really expanded this knowledge!
